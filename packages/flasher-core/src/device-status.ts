// device-status.ts — classify what firmware a board is running, so host
// tooling can decide between the 3 recovery outcomes Phase 7 of
// papilio-works/plans/2026-09-21-papilio-esp-bootloader.md calls for:
//   - "boot log shows loader already" -> just needed the USB-reset nudge.
//   - "boot log shows old 2-slot firmware" -> needs the Phase 8 migration
//     merged-image (not implemented yet, this module only detects it).
//   - "no boot log at all" -> blank/unresponsive board, needs a full flash.
//
// Detection is based on fixed banner text both firmwares already print
// (papilio-esp-bootloader's main.c, FPGA-Companion's mcu_hw.c) plus one
// route (`POST /goto-loader`) that only exists on post-Phase-6
// FPGA-Companion builds -- pre-Phase-6 builds never had net_recovery.c, so
// the same request 404s there instead.
