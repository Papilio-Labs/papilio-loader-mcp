# Papilio Loader MCP Server - Implementation Summary

## What Was Accomplished

Successfully implemented a standalone HTTP/SSE MCP server for the Papilio Loader project, allowing it to run as an independent Windows process that VS Code (or other MCP clients) can connect to over the network.

## Key Changes

### 1. HTTP Server Implementation (`src/papilio_loader_mcp/http_server.py`)

**Previous Implementation:**
- Multiple failed attempts to use `SseServerTransport` API
- Tried `__aenter__/__aexit__`, `handle_sse()`, `get_asgi_app()` - all failed
- Incomplete understanding of MCP SSE transport

**Current Implementation (WORKING):**
```python
from mcp.server.sse import SseServerTransport
from starlette.applications import Starlette
from starlette.routing import Route, Mount

# Create SSE transport
sse = SseServerTransport("/messages/")

# Handle SSE connections
async def handle_sse(request: Request):
    async with sse.connect_sse(
        request.scope,
        request.receive,
        request._send,
    ) as (read_stream, write_stream):
        await app.run(
            read_stream,
            write_stream,
            app.create_initialization_options(),
        )

# Create Starlette app
starlette_app = Starlette(
    debug=True,
    routes=[
        Route("/sse", endpoint=handle_sse),
        Mount("/messages/", app=sse.handle_post_message),
    ],
)
```

**Key Insights:**
- Use `sse.connect_sse()` to establish SSE connection (not context manager)
- Two endpoints needed: `/sse` for connection, `/messages/` for POST messages
- Based on working implementations from `theailanguage/terminal_server` and `microsoft/semantic-kernel`

### 2. VS Code Configuration (`.vscode/mcp.json`)

**Previous:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "papilio-loader": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "papilio_loader_mcp.server"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Current:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "papilio-loader": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8765/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Startup Script (`start_mcp_server.py`)

- Clean startup script with helpful configuration output
- Shows user exactly what to put in `.vscode/mcp.json`
- Ready for Windows service deployment

### 4. Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation:

- **HTTP_SERVER_SETUP.md** - Complete setup guide for HTTP/SSE server
  - Quick start instructions
  - Network access configuration
  - Windows service setup (NSSM and Task Scheduler)
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Security considerations

- **Updated README.md** - Added standalone server section
  - Benefits of HTTP/SSE vs stdio
  - Usage instructions
  - Windows service setup

## Research Findings

### GitHub MCP Server Examples

Searched GitHub for working SSE implementations and found:

1. **theailanguage/terminal_server** - Clean example using Starlette + SSE
   - `sse_server/terminal_server_sse.py`
   - Uses `sse.connect_sse()` method
   - Two endpoints: `/sse` and `/messages/`

2. **microsoft/semantic-kernel** - Official Microsoft implementation
   - `python/samples/demos/mcp_server/sk_mcp_server.py`
   - Same pattern as terminal_server
   - Shows both stdio and SSE modes

3. **Key Pattern Discovered:**
   ```python
   sse = SseServerTransport("/messages/")
   
   async def handle_sse(request):
       async with sse.connect_sse(request.scope, request.receive, request._send) as (read, write):
           await server.run(read, write, server.create_initialization_options())
   ```

## Technical Architecture

### Before (stdio mode)
```
VS Code ──> spawns python ──> stdio ──> MCP Server ──> Serial Ports
           (process per session)
```

**Issues:**
- VS Code has to spawn server process
- One server instance per VS Code session
- Can't run as Windows service
- Limited to local machine only

### After (HTTP/SSE mode)
```
VS Code ───────HTTP/SSE────────┐
                               ▼
WSL/Linux ────HTTP/SSE─────> MCP Server ──> Serial Ports
                             (standalone process)
Remote IDE ───HTTP/SSE────────┘
```

**Benefits:**
- Server runs independently
- Multiple clients can connect
- Can run as Windows service
- Network accessible
- Better for remote scenarios

## Server Endpoints

The HTTP/SSE server exposes two endpoints:

1. **`GET /sse`** - Initiates SSE connection
   - Client connects here to start receiving server messages
   - Long-lived connection for streaming

2. **`POST /messages/`** - Receives client messages
   - JSON-RPC requests from client
   - Tool calls, responses, etc.

## Testing Status

✅ Server starts successfully
✅ Listens on http://127.0.0.1:8765
✅ SSE endpoint available at /sse
✅ No errors in server logs
⏳ VS Code connection test pending (requires VS Code reload)

## Next Steps

1. **Test VS Code Connection:**
   - Reload VS Code window
   - Open GitHub Copilot Chat
   - Try "List available serial ports"

2. **Test Device Operations:**
   - Connect ESP32/FPGA device
   - Test `get_device_info` tool
   - Test `flash_device` tool

3. **Set Up Windows Service:**
   - Use NSSM to install service
   - Configure autostart
   - Test service restart

4. **Network Access:**
   - Test from WSL
   - Configure firewall
   - Document remote access setup

## Dependencies

The HTTP/SSE server requires:

```
mcp>=1.25.0
starlette>=0.41.0
sse-starlette>=2.3.0
uvicorn>=0.40.0
pyserial>=3.5
